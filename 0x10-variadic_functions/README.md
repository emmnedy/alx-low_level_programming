    Variadic functions

 
      *******************************

Variadic functions, also known as variadic functions, are functions in programming languages that can accept a variable number of arguments. Unlike regular functions, which have a fixed number of parameters, variadic functions allow you to pass a flexible number of arguments to the function.
