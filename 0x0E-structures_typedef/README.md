    Structures

A structure in C allows you to group together different types of data into a single unit. It enables you to create complex data structures to represent entities with multiple properties. Each property in a structure is called a member.


    Typedef

The typedef keyword in C allows you to create a new name (alias) for an existing type. It simplifies the syntax and enhances code readability by providing a custom name for a specific type.
