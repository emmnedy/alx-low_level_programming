0x12. C - Singly linked lists


############################




A singly linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements called nodes. Each node in the list contains two fields:

    Data: This field holds the actual value or information of the node.
    Next Pointer: This field is a pointer that points to the next node in the list.

The last node in the list points to NULL since there is no node after it, indicating the end of the list.

To implement a singly linked list in C, you would typically define a structure for the nodes and write functions to manipulate the list, such as creating new nodes, inserting elements, deleting elements, and traversing the list.
