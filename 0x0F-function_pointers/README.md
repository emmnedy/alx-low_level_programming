      C - Function pointers

*************
__________----------


 In C, function pointers are variables that store the memory address of a function. They allow indirect access to functions, enabling dynamic function invocation and facilitating more flexible and powerful programming techniques. Function pointers are particularly useful for implementing callbacks, creating function arrays, and implementing dynamic dispatch.
